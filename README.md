# Pinak Ideas Lab – AI Generated Landing Page

This project is a modern, responsive landing page created using **prompt engineering** and **AI-generated HTML & CSS**.  
The assignment required building a clean and structured UI featuring exactly five sections:
- Navigation Bar  
- Hero Section  
- Services Section  
- Contact Form  
- Footer  

The entire code (HTML + CSS) was generated using a structured prompt and then implemented manually in VS Code.
